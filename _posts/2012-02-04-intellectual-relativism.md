When you think all opinions are equally valid… when you think you have the right to be taken equally seriously for poorly thought out garbage as for rigorous science… largely because you have never “learned proper"… 

When such a situation takes hold it is increasingly easy for leaders to convince people that they, the people, are themselves already smart.  Then to convince them, as they already want to believe, that their prejudices are actually the result of deep intellectual consideration, which deserves to be respected.  It is far easier to manipulate followers this way than it is to convince folks that they need to put in effort to actually *become* smart.  It also negates any threat to the self-interest of said leaders posed by smart curious people.

Likewise it’s easier to convince people “we’re number one" (woohoo!) than to convince them that they have to put in the hard work necessary to actually *be* number one.

(As an aside, of course it may be neither necessary nor even desirable to achieve that goal - for example merely creating a winner/loser situation where someone’s number one at all may be less mutually beneficial than a win-win - game theory comes into play here but I digress.)

People suffering from intellectual relativism often (usually?) have a blind spot when it comes to self awareness - this sometimes manifests itself in an insistence that others follow different rules in qualifying to speak on a topic than they themselves choose to follow.

For example, [this absolutely garbage post](http://pandodaily.com/2012/01/25/unless-you-are-a-lawyer-please-dont-comment-on-this-post/) which prompted this rambling thought in the first place.  Writing at its most mediocre from a publication I otherwise tend to enjoy.

I suppose you have to love the title’s demand - only comment if you’re a lawyer.  This appears to be missing the subtitle “of course I am not a lawyer myself, yet I will spout pseudo-legalistic nonsense, in an incoherent argument, but your opinions aren’t as valid as mine cos i write for a blog with 'rock-star' writers associated with it".

Intellectual relativism sucks.  When those whose profession is the conduct of public discourse are so heavily mired in it, it doesn’t bode well for the future.
