There’s a sadness permeating our culture today.  Facebook, Twitter, the digital social world inserts itself as a salve.  But it’s artificial.  

As people feel their lives become less meaningful.  As they feel less and less control over them.  As we all falter in our efforts to change our circumstances - for some those efforts are to make their financial lot in life better; for others to use our electoral processes to instigate fundamental changes needed in a society we feel has gone off the rails in many ways - we start to feel an existential angst.

We fill that void with status updates - shouting to the world i exist, i matter, there is a thing that it is to be me and this is it.  Yet the status has overtaken the being - the declaration of being has superseded the being of being.

"Here I am" is not a statement of fact benefiting anyone who reads it, it’s a question in search of validation.  "Here I am?".

If we don’t document we were here perhaps we weren’t.  In a world where reality and the simulacrum overlap so fully, we cannot be confident that a memory held by our future self can be relied upon without a digital note for future reference, as though this most mutable of media is somehow more reliable than our flesh brain.

It is self fulfilling.  Note to self.  I was here.  I don’t have a memory of it as my being here was filled with documenting being here rather than experiencing being here.  I stopped to take a picture of the roses, though I’m sure they would have smelled delightful, had I had a spare moment to indulge that sense.
