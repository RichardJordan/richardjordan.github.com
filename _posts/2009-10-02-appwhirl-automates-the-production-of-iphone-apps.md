AppWhirl aims to automate the production of mobile applications.  We let you build your own app in minutes, free of charge.  We port it to all sorts of multiple device, submit it to all the different app stores, then we share there revenue with you as it sells.

Pretty nice.  Well, right now weâ€™re opening the service up to beta testers with blogs or podcasts they want to turn into a branded mobile application.  If you want to beta test AppWhirl, sign up at http://www.appwhirl.com (dead link now).
