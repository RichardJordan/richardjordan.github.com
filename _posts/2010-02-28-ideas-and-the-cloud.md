Cloud services have made me so much more productive, without me really noticing incremental improvements until I look back and compare. Being a bit ADD, and having an always-on creative mind, they’ve let me harness my creativity yet tame the urges to follow every thought, and instead focus on just one or two, focus on execution.

I have less of an “act now or it’s lost" fear, so I can make better decisions - still quickly but less impulsively.  Ideas are never lost.  They are always just a few clicks away, to be worked on in spare cycles as the interest catches me.

It’s a good way to hone in on a plan when you’re starting point is a vision and understanding of the broad framework of the future - the underlying currents whose waves break in cycles of creativity and expansion.

It’s a personal portfolio strategy. A portfolio of ideas. Put them into practice when you get the chance.  Ideas are freed by writing them down and giving them a chance.  Imprisoning an idea in your mind and never putting it into practice is not protecting the idea.  Protecting an idea.  It’s an odd concept.  Ideas don’t need protecting they need exposure.  Just as describing patents as protecting ideas is such a misnomer. They merely reward someone who had the right circumstances and appropriate resources to acquire legalized control of implementation of that idea, at the expense of reducing its dissemination. That’s not protecting an idea, it’s clipping it’s wings and denying it it’s desire to fly freely and benefit us all.

If the promise of the cloud is anything it’s that it might allow us to share ideas more structured than just blog posts or media, but really share the underlying concepts, share the implementation.
