In the Bond movie A View To A Kill Christopher Walken plays the psychotic product of a genetics experiment designed to produce a race of superhumans, with a penchant for airships and a plan to destroy Silicon Valley with the aim of profiting handsomely.

I guess it’s not surprising then, when I see the blimp belonging to “23 and me" a company that aims to decode your genome for you or something similar, hovering over Mountain View, I cannot help but feel a little bit creeped out by it.  It’s just all a little too View To A Kill for my liking.  I keep expecting Grace Jones to parachute past me.

Of course part of this may be that there’s only room for one Bond Villain in this town, and with my hideous facial disfiguration, that’s my role.
