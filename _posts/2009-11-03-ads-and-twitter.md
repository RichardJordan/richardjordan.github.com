I recently commented on one of my favourite VC blogs - [Both Sides Of The Table](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/10/29/is-it-a-good-idea-to-have-ads-in-tweets/)

As an aside, this is the first time I’ve done this.  I am usually a lurker.  But I like Disqus - the idea that if I comment it’s not lost in the ether, it’s easy for me to keep track of.  Now my comments are a conversation, and part of my constant process of learning.

I responded to the comments of someone who just seemed to want to argue with Mark Suster, whose blog it is, and insisted no-one wants ads in tweets.  No-one wants ads anywhere and having them pushed at him was unacceptable.

> I think the push question you raise - why the acceptance of push - is more about the fact that certain types of information have a value that rapidly decreases with time… so it’s natural that access to that information migrates to a feeds/streams type architecture, where you can mine back for old data if you want to, but more likely you’ll just want whatever is recent. i.e. where relevance is a function of time.
> 
> Push is possibly an unfortunate term as it’s misleading and potentially aggressive sounding. We all learn pushers are bad, right?
> 
> Now if you start thinking about the move towards accessing content via devices with more limited interfaces - think mobile - you need filtering mechanisms for relevance, and a feed/stream with it’s time-based filtering is natural, no?
> 
> I’d place a bet (read: I am placing a bet) that over the next few years more and more Internet interaction will be via mobile applications based on feed/stream architectures. In that context “push" is the right way (or one right way) to do things - the push adds value.
> 
> If some of what is pushed is well-targeted commercial messaging that helps direct me to things to buy/interact with - ads - I don’t think that has to be an obtrusive thing. Indeed the market will find the right level for ads. TV stations found that whatever it is - 7 minutes per hour - was about the limit before audience drop off counteracted additional ad dollars. Ad.ly and the like will go on a similar voyage of discovery and find the right level.

This did little to satisfy the individual, and more argument ensued.  The point I wanted to finish with was simple though:

> i think you’re arguing apples and oranges
> 
> it doesn’t matter what users say they will use, it matters what commercial 
> reality can be created to fund the creation and delivery of the content they use
> the only question that matters is what the market delivers through A/B testing, 
> which is what TV effectively did over decades, and then as technologies change 
> new models need to be found
> 
> what you WANT, and whether you WANT to get ads in something is only relevant 
> insofar as you act on that and you make up some portion of the market, which in 
> the aggregate will make the decision
> 
> your response seems not to understand that

I think I am going to unpack these thoughts in coming weeks, on this blog.  Perhaps eventually putting together a white paper, as with AppWhirl we’re placing a big bet on a set of trends in consumption of media and accessing audiences (selling attention) that are powerful, inevitable and earthshaking.
