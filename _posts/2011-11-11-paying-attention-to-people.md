*I wish I had taken a note of which obituary in particular made me think to write this note, but then perhaps its point is better made in the not knowing*

I hate it when somebody dies and their obituary makes me regret that I didn’t pay more attention to them during their life.  Which makes me think I wish I paid more attention to everybody I interact with in my life.  

My reason or excuse might be that I am building a company and changing the world, or I am putting food on the table for my family and a roof over their heads, or I am taking care of two growing children, one of whom has special needs.  That all takes so much focus and concentration I find it hard to direct as much of either as I’d like, towards other people.  Or so my internal narrative goes.

Not paying attention means that so many people we know or know of really are known to us only as caricatures.
