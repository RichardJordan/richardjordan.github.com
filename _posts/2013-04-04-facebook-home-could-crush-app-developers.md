I was reading [this Om Malik post](http://gigaom.com/2013/04/04/why-facebook-home-bothers-me-it-destroys-any-notion-of-privacy/) and the accompanying Hacker News thread, when this point jumped out at me:

It wants to be the start button for apps that are on your Android device, which in turn will give Facebook a deep insight on what is popular. And of course, it can build an app that mimics the functionality of that popular, fast-growing mobile app. I have seen it done before, both on other platforms and on Facebook.

Most of the comments are about the privacy concerns, or the Facebook good/Facebook bad back-and-forth.  But what surprised me was that this point didn’t get more play.

As a developer this should be of great concern.  I expect to see far more of the conversations which have been alleged in the past which go along the lines “hey, we like your company, let us buy you for \[lowball figure] or we’ll crush you by building out the technology ourselves, after all we already have all the data".
